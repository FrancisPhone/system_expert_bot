### 2. Input
The input parameters for the procedure are:

* `FromDate`: A `DATETIME` value representing the start date of the period.
* `ToDate`: A `DATETIME` value representing the end date of the period.

### 3. Output

### 4. Tables
The procedure uses the following tables:

* `booking`: A table containing information about bookings.
* `rent`: A table containing information about rents.

### 5. Logic
The procedure uses the following logic:

1. It selects the `Month`, `Year`, `spacePrice`, `sysFee`, and `total` columns from the `booking` table, joined with the `rent` table on the `bid` column.
2. It filters the results to include only bookings with a status of 'completed' and an end time between the `FromDate` and `ToDate` parameters.
3. It groups the results by `Month` and `Year`.
4. It calculates the total space price, platform fee, and total revenue for each month by summing the corresponding columns.

### 6. Operations
The procedure performs the following operations:

* `SELECT`: Retrieves data from the `booking` and `rent` tables.
* `INNER JOIN`: Combines data from the `booking` and `rent` tables based on the `bid` column.
* `WHERE`: Filters the results to include only bookings with a status of 'completed' and an end time between the `FromDate` and `ToDate` parameters.
* `GROUP BY`: Groups the results by `Month` and `Year`.
* `SUM`: Calculates the total space price, platform fee, and total revenue for each month.

### 7. Use Case
The use case for this procedure is to calculate the monthly revenue for a given date range. For example, to calculate the monthly revenue for the year 2025, you would call the procedure with the following parameters:

```sql
CALL sp_MonthlyRevenue('2025-01-01', '2025-12-31');
```

This would return a list of monthly revenues for the year 2025, including the total space price, platform fee, and total revenue for each month.
