**SQL Procedure Analysis: `sp_PopularDay`**
=====================================================

### 1. Overview
The `sp_PopularDay` SQL procedure is designed to retrieve the most popular days for bookings within a specified date range. It calculates the total number of bookings, total space price, and total platform fee for each day.

### 2. Input
The procedure takes two input parameters:

* `FromDate`: The start date of the range (inclusive).
* `ToDate`: The end date of the range (inclusive).

Both parameters are of type `DATETIME`.

### 3. Output
The procedure returns a result set with the following columns:

* `Day`: The day of the week (e.g., 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc.).
* `Total Bookings`: The total number of bookings for each day.
* `Space Price`: The total space price for each day.
* `Platform Fee`: The total platform fee for each day.

The result set is ordered by the total number of bookings in descending order.

### 4. Tables
The procedure uses two tables:

* `booking`: The table containing booking information.
* `rent`: The table containing rent information, which is joined with the `booking` table.

### 5. Logic
The procedure follows these steps:

1. It selects the `Day`, `id`, `spacePrice`, and `sysFee` columns from the `booking` table, joined with the `rent` table on the `bid` column.
2. It filters the results to include only bookings with an `endTime` between the specified `FromDate` and `ToDate`, and a `status` of either 'completed' or 'booked'.
3. It groups the results by the `Day` column.
4. It calculates the total number of bookings, total space price, and total platform fee for each group.
5. It orders the result set by the total number of bookings in descending order.

### 6. Operations
The procedure performs the following operations:

* `SELECT`: Retrieves data from the `booking` and `rent` tables.
* `INNER JOIN`: Combines data from the `booking` and `rent` tables.
* `WHERE`: Filters the results based on the specified date range and booking status.
* `GROUP BY`: Groups the results by the `Day` column.
* `COUNT`: Calculates the total number of bookings for each group.
* `SUM`: Calculates the total space price and platform fee for each group.
* `ORDER BY`: Orders the result set by the total number of bookings in descending order.

### 7. Use Case
The `sp_PopularDay` procedure can be used to:

* Analyze booking trends and identify the most popular days for bookings.
* Determine the total revenue generated by bookings on each day.
* Identify days with high platform fees and optimize pricing strategies accordingly.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose you want to analyze booking trends for the year 2025. You can call the `sp_PopularDay` procedure with the following parameters:
```sql
CALL sp_PopularDay('2025-01-01', '2025-12-31');
```
This will return a result set showing the most popular days for bookings in 2025, along with the total number of bookings, total space price, and total platform fee for each day.
