**SQL Procedure Analysis: `sp_SpaceRecommend`**
=====================================================

### 1. Overview
The `sp_SpaceRecommend` SQL procedure is designed to recommend available spaces to a user based on their preferred price range, location, and availability. It takes into account the user's booking history and space ratings to provide a list of recommended spaces.

### 2. Input
The procedure takes the following input parameters:

* `uid`: The ID of the user (INT)
* `location`: The location where the user is searching for spaces (VARCHAR(100))
* `startTime`: The start time of the search period (TIMESTAMP)
* `endTime`: The end time of the search period (TIMESTAMP)
* `priceVariation`: The variation in price from the user's preferred range (FLOAT)

### 3. Output
The procedure returns a list of recommended spaces, including:

* `Space Name`: The name of the space (VARCHAR)
* `hourlyRate`: The hourly rate of the space (FLOAT)
* `halfdayRate`: The half-day rate of the space (FLOAT)
* `fulldayRate`: The full-day rate of the space (FLOAT)
* `rating`: The rating of the space (FLOAT)

### 4. Tables
The procedure uses the following tables:

* `user`: The user table, which contains information about the user's preferred price range.
* `space`: The space table, which contains information about available spaces.
* `booking`: The booking table, which contains information about bookings made by the user.

### 5. Logic
The procedure follows these steps:

1. Retrieve the user's preferred price range from the `user` table.
2. Calculate the upper and lower limits of the price range based on the user's preferred range and the `priceVariation` input parameter.
3. Retrieve available spaces that match the user's location and price range.
4. Filter out spaces that are fully booked during the search period.
5. Join the available spaces with the user's booking history to determine the number of bookings for each space.
6. Order the recommended spaces based on the number of bookings and space ratings.
7. Return the top 10 recommended spaces.

### 6. Operations
The procedure performs the following operations:

* Read: Retrieves data from the `user`, `space`, and `booking` tables.
* Write: None
* Update: None
* Delete: None

### 7. Use Case
The `sp_SpaceRecommend` procedure can be used in the following scenarios:

* A user searches for available spaces in a specific location and price range.
* The procedure returns a list of recommended spaces based on the user's booking history and space ratings.
* The user can select a recommended space to book, and the procedure can be used to update the booking information.

**Example Use Case:**
```sql
CALL sp_SpaceRecommend(1, 'Downtown', '2025-02-12 10:00:00', '2025-02-12 13:00:00', 10);
```
This call recommends available spaces in the "Downtown" location with a price range variation of 10% from the user's preferred range. The procedure returns a list of recommended spaces, including their hourly rates, half-day rates, full-day rates, and ratings.
