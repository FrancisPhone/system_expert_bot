### 4. Tables
The `sp_BookSpace` procedure uses the following tables:

* `space`: A table containing information about available spaces, including their hourly rate, half-day rate, and full-day rate.
* `booking`: A table containing information about bookings, including the customer ID, space ID, booking date, start and end times, total price, status, and remarks.

### 5. Logic
The logic of the `sp_BookSpace` procedure is as follows:

1. Calculate the duration of the booking in hours using the `TIMESTAMPDIFF` function.
2. Determine the price of the booking based on the duration:
	* If the duration is less than 12 hours, the price is calculated as the hourly rate multiplied by the duration.
	* If the duration is between 12 and 24 hours, the price is calculated as the hourly rate multiplied by the duration minus 12 hours, plus the half-day rate.
	* If the duration is more than 24 hours, the price is calculated as the full-day rate multiplied by the duration.
3. Set the status of the booking to 'booked'.
4. Insert a new record into the `booking` table with the calculated price and other relevant information.

### 6. Operations
The `sp_BookSpace` procedure performs the following operations:

* Read: Reads data from the `space` table to calculate the price of the booking.
* Write: Inserts a new record into the `booking` table.
* Update: Updates the `status` column of the new record in the `booking` table to 'booked'.

### 7. Use Case
